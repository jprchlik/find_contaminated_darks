fit_ports_gui.py
================
A python GUI for fitting the long term pedestal trend of the IRIS CCDs. 
The program uses the sav file created by the main IDL program, 
so no additional file formatting required. To run the program type the following command:  
> python fit_ports_gui.py  

in a terminal window. 

The python GUI imports the following modules. I also included the version my code works with the modules
in case any future issues arise.

    a. matplotlib 2.0.0
    b. numpy 1.11.3
    c. Tkinter Revision: 81008
    d. scipy 1.0.0
